<span style="font-weight: bold; font-size: 18px">EasyBiz (🏗️ rebuilt in-progress)</span>

EasyBiz is a web application that simplifies invoicing, client management, and quotation handling for small businesses. It allows users to create, send, and track invoices, manage customer data, and seamlessly convert quotations into invoices.

Initially built with Node.js and Express on the backend, I chose to rebuilt it using Ruby on Rails to explore this full-featured framework and improve my skills with it. The frontend is developed with React, and the application ensures compliance with legal accounting standards.
You'll soon be able to follow the progress on my public repository.
