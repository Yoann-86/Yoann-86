# 👋 Hi there, I'm Yoann

A full-stack junior developer.

## 🚀 About Me

I’m 37 years old and currently enrolled in the CDA program at [O'clock school](https://oclock.io/formations/concepteur-developpeur-d-applications), which lasts 1050 hours of theory, followed by a 6-month internship to become Full-stack web developer. During this program, I am learning to develop structured and secure applications using JavaScript and its surrounding ecosystem.
<br>
I have a passion for coding and what can be accomplished with it. I enjoy discovering new things and understanding how they work.
<br>
I am aware of the challenges associated with such a career change and I am deeply committed to everything I undertake. This is why I am fully dedicated and do not hesitate to go above and beyond expectations in my assignments or explore new areas.
