## 🚀 About Me

I’m 38 years old and currently enrolled in a 6-month internship **@matera-tech** as a front-end developer. I have more than 10 years working experience in both domains, and I do my better everyday to become a good developer.
<br>
I have a passion for coding and what can be accomplished with it. I enjoy discovering new things and understanding how they work.
<br>
I am aware of the challenges associated with such a career change and I am deeply committed to everything I undertake. This is why I am fully dedicated and do not hesitate to go above and beyond expectations in my assignments or explore new areas.

## 📚 Currently Focus

- **Matera 6-month internship as a software engineer**

  **My role at Matera:**<br>
  I'm focused on migrating components to our new design system, implementing TypeScript and integrating the latest proxy service for backend API queries. I'm thrilled to be learning every day within this great team while developing strong frontend development skills.
  I can also explore the Ruby language with the Rails framework, which I find amazing. I intend to enhance my backend skills with this framework.
